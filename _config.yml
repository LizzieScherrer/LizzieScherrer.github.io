  As a Computer Science student, I am dedicated to exploring the cutting-edge of technology and all of it's potential. I have gained my skills through hands-on projects and coursework. Throughout my collegiate career I have become increasingly more interested in the unbounded limits of technology and I'm excited to bring forth my skills into a real-world setting. I also love to run, play soccer and am a big Buffalo Bills fan.
